# Government Welfare Chatbot: Requirements

## Vision

**Bridging the gap between government welfare schemes and the citizens who need them most.**

Millions of Indians—farmers, senior citizens, students, women, and rural communities—remain unaware of welfare schemes designed to support them. Complex portals, language barriers, and low digital literacy create invisible walls between citizens and their rightful benefits.

This AI-powered chatbot breaks down those walls. It speaks your language, understands your needs, and guides you step-by-step to discover and access government schemes—whether you're in a village with 2G connectivity or a city with high-speed internet.

**Our Mission:** Make every government welfare scheme accessible to every Indian citizen, regardless of language, literacy, or location.

## Who We Serve

- **Rural Citizens**: Farmers, agricultural workers, and village communities with limited internet access
- **Senior Citizens**: Elderly individuals seeking pension and healthcare schemes
- **Students**: Young Indians looking for education scholarships and skill development programs
